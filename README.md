# GuardHarmony
How do I keep track of the noise that the child makes? And how do I rank the intensity?
** We can have a noise tracker. The intensity would be ranked from 1-100. if it reaches 100, game over**
** So the goal of the player is to keep it below 100**
** Since the noise tracker is only for the father, we put it in the father class ** 
** Each function of harmony should have intensity of its own**
**The user should match the appropriate response, that reduces the noise meter** 


How do I keep track of time?
** We can have a class dedicated for time**

How do the methods of the family members affect the game such that the father wont stay awake?
